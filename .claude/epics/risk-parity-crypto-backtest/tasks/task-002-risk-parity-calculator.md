# Task: Risk Parity Calculator

## Description
Implement the core risk parity portfolio construction engine that calculates equal risk contribution weights using correlation matrices, handles portfolio constraints, and optimizes for risk-adjusted returns with cryptocurrency-specific considerations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Correlation Matrix**: Calculate rolling correlation matrices for selected cryptocurrencies
- [ ] **Risk Parity Weights**: Implement equal risk contribution algorithm with numerical optimization
- [ ] **Portfolio Constraints**: Enforce no short selling, weights sum to 1, optional leverage limits
- [ ] **Risk Estimation**: Compute portfolio volatility and individual asset risk contributions
- [ ] **Optimization Engine**: Use scipy.optimize for constrained portfolio optimization
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling**: Manage singular matrices, extreme correlations, and insufficient data
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Verify calculations match academic risk parity formulas

## Technical Requirements
### Core Algorithm
```python
# Risk parity objective function
def risk_parity_objective(weights, cov_matrix):
    """
    Minimize sum of squared differences between 
    risk contributions and equal risk target (1/N)
    """
    portfolio_vol = np.sqrt(weights.T @ cov_matrix @ weights)
    risk_contrib = (weights * (cov_matrix @ weights)) / portfolio_vol
    target_contrib = 1.0 / len(weights)
    return np.sum((risk_contrib - target_contrib) ** 2)

# Constraints
constraints = [
    {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.sum(w) - 1.0},  # weights sum to 1
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda w: w}  # no short selling
]
```

### Mathematical Framework
- **Covariance Estimation**: Rolling 252-day correlation with exponential decay
- **Risk Contribution**: RC_i = w_i * (Σw)_i / σ_p where σ_p is portfolio volatility
- **Optimization**: Minimize Σ(RC_i - 1/N)² subject to constraints
- **Regularization**: Add L2 penalty for extreme weights when correlation breaks down

### Implementation Details
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Leverage optimized matrix operations for performance
- **Robust Estimation**: Use shrinkage estimators for correlation matrices
- **Numerical Stability**: Handle near-singular matrices with eigenvalue clipping
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process large correlation matrices in chunks if needed
- **Caching**: Store computed weights and risk metrics for reuse

## Files to Create/Modify
- `backend/engines/risk_parity.py` - Main risk parity calculation engine
- `backend/models/portfolio.py` - Portfolio data structures and validation
- `backend/utils/matrix_utils.py` - Matrix operations and numerical stability
- `backend/services/correlation_service.py` - Correlation matrix computation
- `tests/test_risk_parity.py` - Comprehensive calculation tests

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions with known inputs/outputs
- **Mathematical Tests**: Verify against academic papers and benchmarks
- **Edge Case Tests**: Singular matrices, perfect correlation, insufficient data
- **Performance Tests**: Large portfolio optimization within time limits
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end portfolio construction with real data

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Risk contributions within 1% of equal target (1/N)
- **Performance**: Calculate optimal weights for 20 assets in <5 seconds
- **Stability**: Consistent results across multiple optimization runs
- **Robustness**: Graceful handling of problematic correlation structures
- **Validation**: Match published risk parity index methodologies within 0.1%

## Dependencies
- Historical price data from OKX API integration task
- NumPy, SciPy, pandas for mathematical operations
- Academic risk parity methodology papers for validation

## Mathematical Validation
Test against known benchmarks:
- **Simple Case**: 2-asset portfolio with known correlation
- **Academic Papers**: Replicate results from "Risk Parity Fundamentals" (Roncalli, 2013)
- **Index Benchmarks**: Compare with published risk parity cryptocurrency indices
- **Stress Tests**: Extreme market conditions (2018 crypto crash, 2020 pandemic)

## Notes
- Focus on numerical stability over theoretical purity
- Consider crypto-specific characteristics (higher volatility, fat tails)
- Implement robust error handling for optimization failures
- Document mathematical assumptions and limitations clearly
