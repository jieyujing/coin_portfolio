# PRD: Risk Parity Crypto Backtest

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive cryptocurrency portfolio backtesting platform that implements risk parity strategies using real-time OKX V5 API data. The system automatically constructs portfolios from top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, applies equal risk contribution weighting, and provides detailed performance analysis through an interactive web dashboard. Targeted at retail traders and professional trading firms requiring sophisticated backtesting capabilities with rigorous benchmark comparisons.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Limited Risk Management**: Most crypto portfolio tools use naive equal-weight or market-cap-weighted approaches without proper risk adjustment
- **Lack of Professional Backtesting**: Existing tools lack sophisticated rebalancing rules, transaction cost modeling, and comprehensive benchmark analysis
- **Poor Data Integration**: Limited access to real-time, high-quality cryptocurrency market data for accurate backtesting
- **Static Analysis**: Most platforms provide only historical reports without interactive parameter adjustment capabilities

### Why This Matters Now
The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, requiring institutional-grade portfolio management tools. Professional traders need sophisticated risk management techniques previously available only in traditional asset management, adapted for the unique characteristics of crypto markets.
